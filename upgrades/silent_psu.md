The power supply installed from the factory has the fan on all the time, making it impossible to place the printer in a quiet room. This problem can be solved very easily by simply replacing the power supply :) 
I bought a mean well lrs-350-24, for ~10$, and now, the power supply only turns on the fans when it reaches 50 degrees inside. After printing is finished, the printer automatically shuts down and is completely silent.

The lrs-350-24 has the same seating locations as the stock power supply, so you will need to replace it: 
0. Turn off printer, disconnect power cable, wait 30s for the capacitors to discharge.
1. Disconnect the old power supply (terminals at the bottom of the power supply, under the plastic cover).

3. Unscrew 4 screws holding it inside the case.

4. Remove the old power supply.
5. Connect the new power supply in the same way as the old one, with all terminals arranged in the same way.
6. Secure it with the 4 screws inside the case.
Profit!
